                        <h1>About RvB</h1>
                        <p>Red vs. Blue (RvB) is a SWIFT-run competition that enables its teams competing in CCDC
                            and
                            CPTC to share their technical knowledge and expertise with other students. RvB is
                            modeled
                            after CCDC and places a team of 4 students into a vulnerable network they have to
                            protect.
                            SWIFT board, alumni, and volunteers act as an adversary trying to compromise the network and
                            give
                            students a unique experience of troubleshooting and incident response in an active
                            breach
                            scenario. Originating from a partnership between SWIFT and Troy High School, we aim to
                            expand this opportunity for SWIFT members and give the competition experience into
                            everyone's hands.</p>

                        <h1>How RvB Works</h1>
                        <p>
                            RvB uses three main metrics to give points to participants: Secure Configuration Score
                            (SCS), Service Uptime, and Injects.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Secure Configuration Score (SCS)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our scoring engine checks for specific security configurations that you should implement.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Service Uptime</h3>
                        <p>
                            RvB mocks a real business. Keeping your business up and actually functional is important.
                            You
                            get a small amount of points every few minutes if you keep your service functional. However,
                            if you are unable keep your service operational for too long, you will receive a point
                            penalty.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Injects</h3>
                        <p>Throughout the competition, as if defending your network from an active red wasn't enough,
                            your team will receive additional business tasks, injects, from the business that hired you.
                            Submitting injects will reward you with extra points, but make sure to do it before
                            the deadline or no points for you.
                        </p>
