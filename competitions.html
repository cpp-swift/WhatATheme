                        <p>CCDC is a national blue teaming competition that challenges student to maintain and protect a
                            simulated corporation. CCDC challenges a variety of skills, maintaining a companyâ€™s
                            day-to-day operations, managing networks, and hardening main services in Linux and Windows.
                            Many industries recognize CCDC as real world technical experience. To prepare, SWIFT invites
                            all students for weekly CCDC training starting summer till the end of nationals.</p>

                        <p>CPTC is a national red teaming competition that challenges students to penetrate and attack
                            by exploiting vulnerabilities in order to extract as much damaging information as possible.
                            SWIFT provides training in both areas of securing and penetrating corporations; with an
                            understanding of both practices, we hope students will thrive in the competition as well as
                            the real world. SWIFT has been a huge supporter in all cybersecurity competitions, absorbing
                            the same expenses for our CPTC competitors as CCDC.</p>
