                            CCDC is a national blue-teaming competition that challenges students to maintain and protect a
                            simulated business environment. Throughout the competition, students are tasked with maintaining a companyâ€™s
                            day-to-day operations, managing networks, and hardening services in Linux and Windows.
                            Many industries recognize CCDC as quality, real-world technical experience. SWIFT invites
                            all students from Cal Poly Pomona to attend a cybersecurity training bootcamp for both CCDC 
                            and CPTC that begins in June.

                        <p>
                            CPTC is a national penetration testing competition that challenges students to penetrate a business-
                            simulated network by exploiting vulnerabilities in order to extract as much information as possible.
                            SWIFT provides training in both areas of securing and penetrating corporations, as well as 
                            writing a quality, in-depth report that will be presented to a panel of C-Level executives. With an
                            understanding of both technical skills and business objectives, competitiors will thrive in 
                            a consulting role, dealing with cybersecurity and business. SWIFT hosts a cybersecurity training bootcamp for 
                            CCDC and CPTC starting in June, and everyone is welcome to attend!
